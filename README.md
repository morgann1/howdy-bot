# Howdy Bot

Nearly identical to Guilded's Howdy bot, this application was designed for one thing, and that is to greet users whenever they join a server.

# Installation

* Install node from either [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) with nvm

# NVM

Windows:

```ps1
> scoop install nvm
> nvm list available # Gets current & lts versions of node
> nvm install version # Replace 'version' with the version of node you want
> nvm use version # The 'use' command must be executed in a shell with Administor privileges (Run as Administrator)
```

Linux:

The Github repository [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) has a [guide on how to install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) depending on your distribution
